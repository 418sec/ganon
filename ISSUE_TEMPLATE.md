There is currently a method called `<methodName>` that lives in `/lib/<methodName>.js`.
It is incomplete and needs to be fixed!

### Acceptance Criteria:
1. Running `yarn test <methodName>` results in tests passing.

#### Please include the skeleton of a new method + an accompanying test for someone else to work on at the time of creating a pull request!
